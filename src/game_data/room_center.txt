Center Room

This room is where the player character begins their journey.

The room is poorly lit by a skylight 50 feet above the floor. There are a few pieces of shoddy furiniture - a desk, a cupboard and an old lamp. 

On each wall is a candlestick. When that candlestick is pulled, a door opens to the room in that direction. For example, the candlestick on the northernmost wall opens a door to the north room. As stated in your instructions, that room is described by "room_north.txt."

There is a box of matchsticks with two matches on the desk.

There is a rusty dagger and quart of oil in the cupboard.
